This project has been a huge test of limitations for me and has been so challenging, but very fun at the same time. Our theme was “everything is alive”, and I wanted to show that through my game with moving platforms for my character to have to deal with. Originally the concept for the game included falling walls and hidden rooms (more along the lines of living stuff) but as I found, it became harder to even get moving platforms to work. Mister Ball is my finished product, this is just a concept so there is only one level with mostly working parts. In the future I would love to get my buttons and doors working. 

This project has been of my very own creation, and I actually did not use any assets premade for my final design. All level designs, artworks, character design, and level building was done by myself – this also gave me the chance to improve my skills at graphic design and tile mapping (which I had never done before). I had a lot of help on the coding side from various YouTube videos, I’d say my game is an amalgamation of many different tutorials online, some google searching, and of course trial and error. 

The game is a simple 2D platformer with WASD & Space Bar, or arrow keys to move. There are double jumps, wall slides, and wall jumps incorporated into the game code to allow the player freedom to jump to high places. The goal of the game is to get from point A to point B as Mister Ball where you will then move onto the next level, but be careful. There is lava, moving platforms, and hidden buttons to keep you from getting to where you need to go.
